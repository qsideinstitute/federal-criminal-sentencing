# Regression Analysis

Now that we’ve properly conducted an EDA of our federal sentencing data and have an understanding of the context and the structure of the data, we can dive into analyzing this data further! 

One main way that we analyze data is through fitting regressions. Regressions can be used to model the relationships between different explanatory variables and a chosen response variable. There are many kinds of regressions, but the most common and simplest regression is a simple linear regression. To explore linear regression, let's first take a step back from the federal sentencing data, and turn to two simpler data sets for examples.  

## Fitting a line: The basics

Suppose we want to predict how much electricity the city of Los Angeles, California will use based on the daily temperature. As the temperature goes higher, more people will turn on their air conditioners and use more electricity. We can look at past electricity use data and compare it to the temperature each day to get a sense of how these two attributes are related. Knowing and understanding how two variables relate can help you plan for future possibilities or identify and correct patterns that you don't want to continue. For example, we can use this relationship to makes predictions of how much electricity Los Angeles will use in the future if we know the future temperature, and make sure that there is enough for the city's needs.

Let's make two example points, point A at (1,2) and point B at (3,5). In R, we will save these points in a data frame using a vector of the x values, 1 and 3, and a vector of the matching y values, 2 and 5.

```{r}
twopoints <- data.frame(xvals = c(1, 3), 
                        yvals = c(2, 5), 
                        label = c("A","B"))
head(twopoints)
```

We can make a fairly simple plot of these two points, using `geom_point()` as we did in our EDA, and `geom_text()` to label our points. 

```{r twopoints}
twoplot <- ggplot(twopoints, aes(x = xvals, y = yvals)) + 
  geom_point(color = "coral2") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = label), nudge_y = 0.3) +
  xlim(0, 6) + 
  ylim(0, 6)

twoplot
```

### Analytically fit a line to two points

In order to create a linear regression on these two points, we can think back to algebra and use the formula for a line.

$$ 
y = m x + b
$$

Fitting our line to the data is straightforward and can be done in a number of ways. One way is that we can plug both points into the equation of the line and then solve the system together.

$$
\begin{align}
2 &= (1)m + b\\
5 &= (3)m + b
\end{align}
$$

Here we have a system that has two equations and two unknowns ($m$ and $b$), so we know this system has a unique solution! We can solve this system using a variety of techniques---try to solve this system using a technique you are comfortable with and verify that the solution below passes through each of the two points.

$$
y = \frac{3}{2} x + \frac{1}{2}
$$

Next we can plot the results. Here we use the `geom_abline()` function, to plot our linear equation which can be done by inputting the values for the slope and the intercept.

```{r twopoints lm}
twoplot + 
  geom_abline(slope = 3/2, 
              intercept = 1/2)
```

Great! Notice that the line above goes right through our two data points.

### Numerically fit a line to two points

If we want to reduce the amount of calculations required to fit a line to two points, we can instead just rely on R to do the work for us. We can use the linear model function `lm()` to carry out a regression for us. We just input our `yvals` and `xvals` along with our data `twopoints` to fit a linear model using R. 

```{r}
two_lm <- lm(yvals ~ xvals, data = twopoints)
two_lm
```

### Analytically fit a line to three points

We know that two points alone uniquely define a line, but what do we think will happen if we have to find a line that goes through three data points? Let's add the point $(2, 3)$ to our existing set and see what happens when try to draw a line through all three points. Below, we will use R to plot the three points and make multiple attempts to fit a line. Don't worry too much on the coding for now, but pay attention to the resulting plots. 

```{r threepoints line guesses, fig.width=12}

threepoints <- 
  twopoints %>%
  # Add third point to dataset
  add_row(xvals = 2, yvals = 3, label = "C") %>%
  # Generate y values for guesses of regression lines 
  mutate(yfit1 = xvals * 3/2 + 1/2,
         yfit2 = xvals + 1,
         yfit3 = xvals * 2 - 1)

# Plot data points with lines
threeplot <-
  ggplot(threepoints, aes(x = xvals, y = yvals)) + 
  geom_point(color = "coral2")  + 
  geom_text(aes(label = label), 
            nudge_y = 0.3, 
            check_overlap = TRUE) +
  xlim(0,6) + 
  ylim(0,6)

# Display plots
grid.arrange(
  threeplot + 
    geom_abline(slope = 3/2, intercept = 1/2) + 
    geom_segment(aes(xend = xvals, 
                     yend = yfit1), 
                 color = "coral2"),
  threeplot + 
    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 1) + 
    geom_segment(aes(xend = xvals, 
                     yend = yfit2), 
                 color = "coral2"),
  threeplot + 
    geom_abline(slope = 2, intercept = -1) +  
    geom_segment(aes(xend = xvals, 
                     yend = yfit3), 
                 color="coral2"),
  ncol = 3)
```

Notice in all three graphs above, we can't draw a straight line through all three points at the same time. The best that we can do is try to find a line that gets very close to all three points, or fits these three points *the best*. But how can we define "the best" line that fits this data?

To understand which line *best fits* our three data points, we need to talk about the **error**, which is also called the **residual** in statistics. The residual is the vertical distance between the predicted data point $\hat{y}$ (on the line) and the actual value of $y$ our data takes on at that point (the value we collected). In our data set we have the points $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, and $(3, 5)$ so the only actual values for $y$ in our data set are 2, 3, and 5 even though our predicted line, or *linear model*, takes on all values of $y$ between 0 and 6.


### Numerically fit a line to three points

To find the model that best fits our data, we want to make the total error as small as possible. To expand on our definition of linear regression above, linear regression is a technique that allows us to identify the line that minimizes our error. This line is called a *linear regression model* and is the line that best fits our data. Below, we use `lm()` again to fit our linear model to the three data points.

```{r}
three_lm <- lm(yvals ~ xvals, data = threepoints)
three_lm
```

Here R gives us the slope and intercept of the straight line that best fits our data. Let's graph this line together with our data using the code below. 

```{r three points lm}
# Add predicted values (yhat) to data
threepoints <-
  threepoints %>%
  mutate(yhat = 1.5 * xvals + 0.3333)

ggplot(threepoints, aes(x = xvals, y = yvals)) + 
  geom_point(color = "coral2")  + 
  geom_text(aes(label = label), 
            nudge_y = -0.4 ) +
  xlim(0, 6) + 
  ylim(0, 6) + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1.5, intercept = 0.3333) + 
  geom_segment(aes(xend = xvals, 
                   yend = yhat), 
               color = "coral2")
```

Notice that the best fit linear model doesn't go through any of our three points! **Why do you think that is?**

Keep in mind, our goal is to minimize our error as much as we can. In each of the four previous graphs, the error (or the distance between the predicted y value and the actual y value) is shown on the graph, highlighted in the coral color. Of the four plots we just made of lines through our three data points, which one seems to have the smallest error?

> Note: Whenever you employ linear regression, there are various conditions you must make sure are satisfied before proceeding. You can use the acronym L.I.N.E to remember that your residuals must satisfy **L**inearity, **I**ndependence, **N**ormality, and **E**qual variance conditions. For the purposes of this tutorial, we won't go in depth about what these conditions mean and how you can check these conditions, but make sure to keep them in mind for your future data analyses. Conditions are super important in statistical analysis!


## Introduction to linear regression

Now let's turn to another example data set to explore linear regression further. This new data set focuses on penguins. Do you think a linear model might be a good way to model the data? Run the code below load the new dataset and create a scatterplot showing the relationship between flipper length and body mass among penguins. 

```{r penguin scatterplot, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
data(penguins)

pengplot <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point(color = "coral2", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (grams)",
       y = "Flipper Length (mm)",
       title = "Flipper Length by Body Mass of Penguins")

pengplot
```

Take a look at the scatterplot: does it look like most of the data fall along a straight line? If the general shape is a line, then yes, we could try to model this data with linear regression.

```{r penguins lm, warning = FALSE}
pengfit <- lm(flipper_length_mm ~ body_mass_g, data = penguins)
pengfit

pengplot + 
  geom_abline(slope = 0.0152, 
              intercept = 137.0396)
```

### Summarizing a linear regression model

After we fit a linear regression model, we are often interested in summarizing the model and assessing how good the model fits the data. One function we can use for this is `summary()`. This function provides an overview of the fitted model.

```{r}
summary(pengfit)
```

There is a lot of information that comes out of this function, but for now we will focus on the coefficients and the $R^2$ value.

#### Interpreting coefficients for numerical predictors

In the middle of the summary output, the estimated coefficients are provided in the first column of the table. The intercept is $b = 136.7$ and the slope is $m = 0.015$. 

While the **intercept** typically represents the average outcome when all predictors are 0, it doesn't make sense in this case to talk about a penguin with a mass of 0 grams (impossible!), so we will not interpret the intercept.

The **slope** represents the change in the average outcome for a one unit increase in the value of the predictor. In this case, we would say that a one-gram increase in the mass of a penguin is associated with 0.015 mm longer flipper, *on average*.

#### Assessing model fit with $R^2$

Now focus on the bottom of the summary output and find the "Multiple R-squared" value. You probably found $R^2 = 0.759$ from the table. 

$R^2$ represents the proportion of variation in the response variable that is explained by the explanatory variable(s) in your linear model. In our case,  we found that 75.9% of the variation in flipper length can be explained by the body mass of penguins. That is a pretty high $R^2$, especially for observational data! Therefore, we can already consider this model to be quite good for modeling flipper length. 

<!--
Apart from looking at the $R^2$, it is a good idea to look at the resulting $t$-tests and $F$-tests. While t-tests looks at the significance of individual variables by comparing population means, F-tests examine the significance of overall models by comparing population variances. You can see the "t value" column for the test statistics from the t-tests, but you can mainly just focus on the resulting p-values in the "Pr(>|t|)" column. In this case, the p-value for `body_mass_g` is quite low, meaning it is a significant variable in this model predicting flipper length. At the bottom, you can see the F-statistic and associated p-value for the overall model. Again, the p-value is quite low, meaning the model is significant. These two outcomes of the t-test and F-test can increase our confidence in the model even further. 
-->


### Linear regression with a categorical predictor

So far we've only explored linear regression with numerical variables, but we can certainly use categorical variables in our model as well. Continuing with our penguins data, let's compare flipper length to penguin species. Remember that flipper length is a numerical variable and species is a categorical variable with three levels: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

#### Binary categorical predictor 

To start, let's simplify the problem by considering species as only "Gentoo" or "Not Gentoo". We'll use `case_when()` to create this new binary variable (`species2`), then we'll create a side-by-side boxplot using `geom_boxplot()` to view the relationship between flipper length and species.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
penguins <- 
  penguins %>% 
  mutate(species2 = fct_collapse(species,
                               "Not Gentoo" = c("Adelie", "Chinstrap"))) %>% 
  drop_na()

adelieplot <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species2, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_boxplot(color = "coral2", 
               alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Flipper Length (mm)",
       title = "Flipper Length by Gentoo and non-Gentoo Species")
adelieplot
```

We can see that Gentoo penguins seem to have a longer flipper lengths, generally, than non-Gentoo penguins. 

Next, we create a linear model for the same relationship.

```{r}
gentoo_lm <- lm(flipper_length_mm ~ species2, data = penguins)
summary(gentoo_lm)
```

$R^2$ in this case is interpreted in the same way. Find the $R^2$ value for this model. Is it a good fit?

Yes, we see that $R^2 = 0.7514$, which means that about 75% of the variability in flipper length is explained by whether or not the penguins are Gentoo penguins.

How do you think we interpret this model now? You may have noticed that the predictor variable shows up a little differently than you might expect in the coefficient table: it's labeled `species2Gentoo` rather than just `species2`. This is actually a new **indicator variable** that R created to fit the linear model! Because a linear model is a mathematical equation, R converts our categorical variable into a numerical *indicator variable*: it takes on the value 1 if the specified level after the variable name is observed, and 0 otherwise. Our binary species variable `species2` was converted to an indicator variable labeled `species2Gentoo`, which tells us:

$$
\texttt{species2Gentoo} = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if the species is Gentoo}\\
  0 & \text{if the species is not Gentoo}
\end{cases}
$$

(Note: the indicator variable would be reversed if it were instead labeled as `species2Not Gentoo` in the summary output.)

So how do we interpret the coefficients in this model? Let's write out the equation of the regression line to figure it out:

$\widehat{\text{Flipper Length}} = 191.9 + 25.3 (\text{Gentoo})$

"Gentoo" in the equation above is our indicator variable `species2Gentoo`.
If we plug in a 0 for the "Gentoo" indicator variable in the equation to get the predicted average flipper length for *non-Gentoo* species (our *reference* level), we have:

$\widehat{\text{Flipper Length}} = 191.9 + 25.3 (0) = 191.9 \text{ mm}$ 

Notice the predicted average here is exactly the intercept! This tells us that the **intercept** can be interpreted as the average outcome for the reference level of a categorical variable (whichever level takes on the value "0").

If we plug in a 1 for "Gentoo" in the equation to get the predicted average flipper length for Gentoo species, we have:

$\widehat{\text{Flipper Length}} = 191.9 + 25.3 (1) = 217.2 \text{ mm}$

Notice the difference in these two predicted averages is exactly the slope: $217.2 - 191.9 = 25.3$! This tells us that the **slope** can be interpreted as the difference in the average outcome between the indicated level and the reference level. In our case, the flipper length of Gentoo species is, on average, 25.3 mm longer than the flipper length of non-Gentoo species. 

#### Categorical predictor with more than 2 levels

Now let's return to the original `species` variable with three levels. Let's see what happens when we fit the model with this variable.

```{r}
species_lm <- lm(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
summary(species_lm)
```

What do you notice? What do you think has happened?

You should see that instead of a single predictor `species` in the coefficient table, we have two new indicator variables, `speciesChinstrap` and `speciesGentoo`. But we know that `species` has three levels! Where did the Adelie penguins go? Let's think through the math again. For each indicator variable we have:

$$
\texttt{speciesChinstrap} = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if the species is Chinstrap}\\
  0 & \text{if the species is not Chinstrap}
\end{cases} 
\qquad \text{and} \qquad 
\texttt{speciesGentoo} = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if the species is Gentoo}\\
  0 & \text{if the species is not Gentoo}
\end{cases}
$$

Well, if a species is *not* Chinstrap (`speciesChinstrap` = 0) *nor* Gentoo (`speciesGentoo` = 0), then it must be whatever species is left: Adelie! In other words, the Adelie penguins have now become our **reference** level of the species variable: the baseline level against which every other species is compared. We can make predictions for Adelie penguins by plugging in 0s for all the indicator variables. Let's see this in action! 

The equation of the fitted regression line is now:

$\widehat{\text{Flipper Length}} = 190.1 + 5.7 (\text{Chinstrap}) + 27.1 (\text{Gentoo})$

First, let's find the predicted average flipper length for *Adelie penguins* by plugging in 0s for each indicator variable:

$\widehat{\text{Flipper Length}} = 190.1 + 5.7 (0) + 27.1 (0) = 190.1 \text{ mm}$

Next, let's find the predicted average flipper length for *Chinstrap penguins* by plugging in 1 for "Chinstrap" and 0 for "Gentoo":

$\widehat{\text{Flipper Length}} = 190.1 + 5.7 (1) + 27.1 (0) = 195.8 \text{ mm}$

Finally, let's find the predicted average flipper length for *Gentoo penguins* by plugging in 0 for "Chinstrap" and 1 for "Gentoo":

$\widehat{\text{Flipper Length}} = 190.1 + 5.7 (0) + 27.1 (1) = 217.2 \text{ mm}$

Using these predicted average values, we can make the following connections:

* The **intercept** captures the average outcome for the *reference level* of the categorical variable.
* The **slope** of each indicator variable captures the difference in the average outcome between the indicated level and the reference level.
    * For example, if we take the predicted average flipper length of Chinstrap penguins (195.8 mm) and subtract the predicted average flipper length of Adelie penguins (190.1 mm), we get the slope for `speciesChinstrap` (5.7). 
    * In other words, we could interpret the Chinstrap indicator variable coefficient as: "The flipper length of Chinstraps species is, on average, 5.7 mm longer than the flipper length of Adelie species."
* The difference in slopes between two indicator variables will provide the average difference in the outcome between those two levels.
    * For example, if we take the predicted average flipper length of Gentoo penguins (217.2 mm) and subtract the predicted average flipper length of Chinstrap penguins (195.8 mm), we get 21.4. This is the same as taking the difference in the two corresponding slopes: $27.1 - 5.7 = 21.4$.
    
These *pairwise comparisons* or *contrasts* of average flipper length across all three species can be done more quickly in R using the `emmeans()` function of the **emmeans** package, as shown below. To use this function, you need to provide only the name of the fitted linear model (`species_lm`) and which variable contains the levels you want to compare (`species`). 

```{r}
emmeans(species_lm, pairwise ~ species)$contrasts
```

The resulting table lists the *contrast* (which two groups are being compared and what is the order of subtraction), the *estimated* difference in the average outcome between the two groups, and some additional statistics summarizing the results of a type of $t$ test. In this case, because all of the p-values are so small, we have evidence to conclude that flipper lengths significantly differ between each of the three species of penguins.


### Multiple linear regression

Similar to how we were able to build up to plots with three or four variables, a multiple linear regression model allows us to consider the relationship between an outcome and *multiple* predictors at the same time. This is better than fitting a different model for every predictor of interest. We can add predictors to our linear regression model by simply using the plus sign in the linear model formula. Run the code below to see how we model flipper length as a function of both penguin species and body mass.

```{r}
penguin_lm <- lm(flipper_length_mm ~ species + body_mass_g, data = penguins)
summary(penguin_lm)
```

Notice we now have three variables in the coefficient table: the two indicator variables we discussed before *and* the numerical predictor, body mass. We have also explained more of the variation in flipper length by including both species and body mass as predictors in the model rather than either one alone ($R^2 = 0.8526$). Because we have multiple predictors, interpretations of slopes now depend on the other variables in the model. For example, we would now interpet the coefficient for body mass as: "*After adjusting for the species of a penguin*,  a one-gram increase in the mass of a penguin is associated with 0.015 mm longer flipper, on average." Similarly, we could interpret the Chinstrap indicator variable coefficient as: "After adjusting for the body mass of a penguin, the flipper length of Chinstraps species is, on average, 5.5 mm longer than the flipper length of Adelie species."


## Linear Regression with the Federal Criminal Sentencing Data

Now that we've explored the basics of linear regression using both numerical and categorical variables, let's return to the goal of this project: to explore patterns in federal criminal sentencing data from 2006-2020. We will show how to create relevant linear models for this data, and discuss the results of these models in the following section. We won't dive into the specifics of how we determined which variables to include in the linear regression model. Rather, we will simply replicate the results of original study, [Federal Criminal Sentencing: Race-Based Disparate Impact and Differential Treatment in Judicial Districts](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01879-5). 

### Baseline model

Let's start with a simple model to see how sentence length changes by race alone, without considering any other factors. 

```{r}
baselinemod <- lm(sentence_length ~ race, data = us_sent)
summary(baselinemod)
```

Already, we can use some of the methods we used above to summarize the model. How does sentence length seem to differ by race? Considering the $R^2$, is this a good model for our data? 

Recall that the race variable has four categories: Black, Hispanic, White, and another race indicated (ARI). Based on the model output, "Black" is missing from the indicator variables, which tells us that Black defendants are the reference level. Because all of the coefficients are negative, we know that Black defendants tended to have longer sentences, on average, than defendants of every other race. For example, the average sentence length of Black defendants is about 18.5 months longer than the average sentence of White defendants.

We can explore these differences further by obtaining 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients using `confint()` (see the previous case study on [Diversity of Artists in Major U.S. Museums](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/qsideinstitute/Data4Justice-Curriculum/blob/main/Data4Justice-Curriculum-v4.html) for a discussion of confidence intervals):

```{r}
confint(baselinemod)
```

This allows us to estimate the coefficients with some degree of error. Using the same example as before and the bottom row of the table of confidence intervals, we would say we are 95% confident that the average sentence length of Black defendants is between 18.1 and 19 months longer than the average sentence of White defendants.

Returning to the model summary output, you may have noticed that the Multiple $R^2$ is relatively low, indicating that our model using only race as a predictor accounts for only 1.5% of the variation in sentence length. Do you think we can make a better model using more variables to predict sentence length? Of course! Let's jump into replicating one of the models in the original study.


### District II Model

In the paper this case study is based on, the authors apply this model (along with alternate models) across all districts in the data set. In doing this, they were able to compare the disparity in sentences across different races. Let's try employing this model for just one district at a time. Let's start with Arkansas. To only look at the datapoints from Arkansas, we will start with using the `filter()` function. Then, we will fit another model identical to the first linear model, only without `district` as a predictor:

```{r}
us_sent_az <- us_sent %>%
  filter(district == "Arizona")

lm2 <- lm(sentence_length ~ age + sex + educ + year + mandatory_min + guilty_plea + grid_cell +
            gov_departures + race,
          data = us_sent_az,
          model = TRUE, 
          y = TRUE)
```

Let's extract the resulting $R^2$ again to get a sense for how well this model using only data from Arizona predicts sentence length:

```{r}
summary(lm2)$r.squared
```

In the paper, the authors cycle through all districts. While we won't go into how they accomplished this in this case study, we encourage you to look at some other districts of interest to you.

Here is one figure from their paper comparing the minoritized race - white disparity in sentencing using a 95% confidence interval:

*Figure 1: Minoritized Race-White Disparity in Sentence Length (Month) Across U.S. Districts Represented by District I and II models:*

Here is another figure from the paper displaying where these highlighted districts are located across the United States:
