# Federal Criminal Sentencing dataset

The dataset was collected as part of writing the paper: 

Topaz, C. M., Ning, S., Ciocanel, M. V., & Bushway, S. (2023). Federal criminal sentencing: race-based disparate impact and differential treatment in judicial districts. 
_Humanities & Social Sciences Communications_, _10_(366). https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01879-5

Note that the `all_adjustments` column means the _criminal offense level_ (i.e., the numbers that are the rows in the Sentencing Table PDF), after making _all applicable adjustments_ that are in the [United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines](https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines). 
The columns for chapter 2, chapter 3, etc., are the adjustments made from only chapter 2 adjustments; chapter 2 and 3 adjustments cumulatively; and so on.
